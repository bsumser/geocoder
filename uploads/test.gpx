Hello Ricky,  

Today you contacted the Technology Service Desk to receive help with errors with the McAfee antivirus software.

It looks like McAfee hadn't received the permissions necessary to access all of the files on your computer. This can be correct by following the steps detailed at: https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/oracle/webcenter/page/scopedMD/s55728c97_466d_4ddb_952d_05484ea932c6/Page29.jspx?wc.contextURL=%2Fspaces%2Fcp&articleId=TS102979&_afrLoop=115948465030706&leftWidth=0%25&showFooter=false&showHeader=false&rightWidth=0%25&centerWidth=100%25#!%40%40%3FshowFooter%3Dfalse%26_afrLoop%3D115948465030706%26articleId%3DTS102979%26leftWidth%3D0%2525%26showHeader%3Dfalse%26wc.contextURL%3D%252Fspaces%252Fcp%26rightWidth%3D0%2525%26centerWidth%3D100%2525%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dij8oqu7bm_9
